      <h2 class="border-top">About Andy</h2>
        <p>After graduating college, I worked in the financial services industry for a few years. I recently took a huge leap of faith and decided to leave my corporate job to pursue a career as a software developer. I have always had a passion for technology and also enjoy solving intricate problems. I also enjoy traveling and exploring new places. My dream is to be able to travel with my family and be able to work remotely from anywhere. By pursuing a career in this field, I hope to achieve the flexibility to live the lifestyle that I would like to lead.
        </p>

        <p>By becoming a student at <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've taken the first steps on my journey and have not been happier!</p>

        <p class="p-about">If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a partner for a hackathon/meet-up) please reach out! I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
